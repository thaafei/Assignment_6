/* Assignment 6 (100 marks in total; 5% of the final score of this course)
 *
 * Question 4 (20 marks)
 *
 * Write a java program to compute the transpose of a user input matrix,
 * whose elements are all integers.
 *
 * Converting rows of a matrix into columns and columns of a matrix into
 * row is called transpose of a matrix.
 *
 * INPUT: user input matrix (2D array).
 * OUTPUT: the transpose of input matrix.
 *
 * Note: considering how to take users' input, you can set some rules
 * (give users some hints) to make your code user-friendly.
 * User will follow your instruction to input test example.
 *
 * Example:
 * INPUT: 4  6  8
 *        5  8  9
 *        2  1  8
 *
 * OUTPUT: 4  5  2
 *         6  8  1
 *         8  9  8
